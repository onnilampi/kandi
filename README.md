# kandi


This is a just template for my Bachelors thesis, to be completed on the summer of 2017. If you for some reason can't clone this repository and compile my thesis yourself, please refer to https://onnilampi.fi/files/kandi.pdf

After running the setup script, add `$HOME/.cargo/bin` to your `$PATH`

Compile by moving to the thesis folder and running `tectonic kandi.tex`
